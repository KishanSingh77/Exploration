# TO DO LIST

### Learned
- Finished doing python CNN today in PyTorch, great model will learn
- Realized that you learn most in 50 min sessions with 10 min read 20 min implement, 15 min think about question and summarize and 5 min change tasks/plan
- There are a million frameworks out there, learn the best 2 well. Keras and PyTorch. Done with all other frameworks
- Know that there are zoos in caffe2, theano is backend, Microsoft CNTK sucks and does a horrible job of replacing keras, logger useful in pytorch, gan network must learn, and mxnet is alright but mainly useful for R. 
- Gluon also has model zoo in mxnet 
- MXNet used for R if I need, mxnet very similar to pytorch, pretty good to use for R, mxnet is awesome

### Machine Learning and Bio
- Week 5
- Today - finish going over PyTorch till 8, MxNet 9, Caffe2, Microsoft CNTK 9:30 (do not need to implement except for PyTorch implement 2) 
- Today - 12 o clock done with Keras LSTM, word2vec, and etc. 
- Tuesday - ML project done with vision classifier 
- Wednesday - Catch up with all these tutorials. 
- Thursday and Friday and Sunday - Go over sklearn and sns one more time 3 days, review general ML algorithms like SVM, Gradient boosted trees, and etc.   
- Week 6 do all tutorials in keras, pytorch, and finally open ai gym for RL
- Week 7 SWE stuff
- Week 8 sesion/class on ML
- Week 8 Papers in ML
- Week 9 Bio class
- Week 10 Bio Class
- Week 11 Reading Bio Papers and Nature
- Week 12 Reading all Science and Nature magazines


### Software Engineering
